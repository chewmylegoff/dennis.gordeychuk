Reactor Programming Language (RPL) Reference Documentation:

·	Collaborated with developers, network engineers, and testing specialists to gather requirements, review documentation, and ensure accuracy.
·	Conducted thorough research on language behavior, standard libraries, edge cases, and exceptions.
·	Contributed to the development of a clear taxonomy and designed user-friendly navigation.
·	Translated complex engineering concepts and informal explanations into formal specification language, ensuring clarity and precision.
·	Maintained consistency in terminology, definitions, and formatting throughout the documentation.
·	Employed formal styles to create unambiguous documentation.
·	Crafted minimal, correct, and representative code examples, including edge cases, for use in documentation, while preserving more complex examples in a dedicated Gerrit repository.
·	Actively ensured content relevance by updating documentation based on requests from technical specialists and by proactively identifying outdated information.

Authored a three-part tutorial series introducing developers to the Reactor build system:
·	*How to Create the Simplest Reactor Program*
·	*How to Create RPL Modules*
- *How to Create RPL Packages*

These tutorials teach the fundamentals of Reactor project structure, RPL modularization, and package distribution, providing example-based guidance.

Created internal documentation using Confluence, which includes:
·	Workstation setup documentation for the team (Docker, Linux).
·	Procedures for launching local RPL tests.
·	Procedures for running network tests on Jenkins.
·	Several operational manuals for small local utilities and a simplified interaction interface with Docker.

Provided editorial review and guidance to junior technical writers, helping them improve structure, clarity, and technical accuracy.

Integrated AI into the technical writing process, working towards automating AI usage to enhance efficiency in content editing and generation.
